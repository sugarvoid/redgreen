# Red Green
Simple red light, green light app made with Raylib. Not a game.
This is a remake of an app I made with Godot [repo](https://github.com/sugarvoid/red-light-green-light).

## Project Goal
- Get some practice coding in C.
- Have a app with a small build size. (Using Godot, the file size was ~65mb)

## Libraries Used
- Raylib [repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
- Raygui [repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui)
